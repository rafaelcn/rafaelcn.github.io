The sum of two fractions are given:

$$
  \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{6}{3}
$$

Which can be simplified by 3:

$$
  \frac{6}{3} = 2
$$

$$
  V_{rms} = \sqrt{\sum (\overline{X}_{i})^{2}}
$$

But if we were writing a line with some words, it definitely would not get justified as shown in this example.

That's what I hate using markdown.

{% highlight cpp %}

#include <iostream>
#include <bits>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int value = 4;
}

void something()
{
  cout << "this function does not return anything." << endl;
}

{% endhighlight %}
