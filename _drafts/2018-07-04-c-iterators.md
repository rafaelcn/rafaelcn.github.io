## WTF are you implementing iterators in C? Is that even possible?

Calm down, everything is possible in C, just like shooting your foot using it. But I'm here to
report a little experiment I've been doing trying to minimize the amount of work I have to do just
to iterate a list or any list data structure for that matter.

Iterators in C are quite easy to use and using it you feel aproximatelly the same way if you were
using Java or C++, just less safe, more error prone and what not. I tried to minimize a lot of
those problems though.
